Today, I built a dice game using React to practice breaking the project into reusable components. This improved both my development speed and my understanding of React. I plan to continually raise the difficulty of my projects until I become a proficient MERN-stack developer.

Key React Fundamentals I Applied:

1. Component-Based Architecture – I split the UI into smaller, reusable components, making the code easier to manage and extend. 

2.JSX Syntax – I used JSX to write clean, HTML-like code directly within JavaScript, improving readability and maintainability.

3.State & Props – I utilized useState hooks for interactive behavior and passed data between components using props, ensuring clear and predictable data flow. 


4.Virtual DOM & Efficient Updates – React’s Virtual DOM enables efficient rendering by calculating minimal changes and updating only necessary parts of the real DOM.
